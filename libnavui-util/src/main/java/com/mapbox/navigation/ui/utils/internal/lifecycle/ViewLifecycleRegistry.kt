/**
 * A [LifecycleRegistry] that merges the [hostingLifecycleOwner]'s [Lifecycle] (of an Activity or Fragment)
 * with the [View]'s drawing surface lifecycle.
 *
 * This lifecycle is useful for continuously running tasks that obtain the data and draw it in the [View],
 * for example by collecting [Flow]s and drawing results in the nested views or on the map.
 *
 * In general, this lifecycle reflects the [hostingLifecycleOwner]'s [Lifecycle] whenever the `View` is attached
 * but whenever the `View` is detached and we want to stop the coroutines tied to the lifecycle's scope,
 * this lifecycle will transition to [Lifecycle.State.CREATED] (and invoke [Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP])
 * even if the hosting Activity or Fragment is still running.
 *
 * This lifecycle reaches [Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED] only when the [hostingLifecycleOwner] is destroyed.
 *
 * @see keepExecutingWhenStarted
