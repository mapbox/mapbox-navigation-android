 * A simplified data structure containing [BannerComponents.active] and list of [BannerComponents.directions].
 * @property isActive Boolean indicates if that lane can be used to complete the upcoming maneuver.
 * @property drivingSide String indicates the driving side. The value is obtained from [BannerText.drivingSide].
 * However, if null the value determination falls back to [LegStep.drivingSide]
 * @property directions List<String> informs about all the possible directions a particular lane can take.
 * @property activeDirection String shows which of the lane's [directions] is applicable to the current
 * route, when there is more than one. Only available for `mapbox/driving` profile. For other profiles
 * the activeDirection falls back to [BannerText.modifier]
