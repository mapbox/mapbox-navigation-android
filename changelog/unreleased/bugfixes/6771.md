- Introduced `VoiceInstructionsPrefetcher` `MapboxSpeechAPI#generatePredownloaded` to use predownloaded voice instructions instead of downloading them on demand. Example usage can be found in the examples directory ( see `MapboxVoiceActivity`).
- Enabled voice instructions predownloading for those who use `MapboxAudioGuidance`.
- Fixed an issue where with low connectivity voice instruction might have been played too late for those who use `MapboxAudioGuidance`. If you use `MapboxSpeechAPI` directly, switch to voice instructions predownloading as described above if you encounter said issue.
