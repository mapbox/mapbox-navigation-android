- Fixed an issue when adding a stop point on top of an already traversed route, which could show a carried-over vanishing portion from the previous route. That is accomplished by ensuring that `MapboxRouteLineApi.getVanishPointOffset()` returns `0.0` in case the point was in the `VanishingPointState.DISABLED` state.
