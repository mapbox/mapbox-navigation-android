- Route request timeout errors are now considered failures as opposed to cancellations (`NavigationRouterCallback#onFailure` will be invoked instead of `NavigationRouterCallback#onCanceled`).
- Fixed an issue where location might have been snapped to an incorrect road when previously location updates had been inactive.
- Fixed an issue where in case of poor location signal it might have been snapped to a road, which is above/below the correct one.
