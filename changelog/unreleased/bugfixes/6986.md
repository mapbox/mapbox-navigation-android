- Improved duration calculation for EV routes to account for charging time.
- Added snapping feature to the navigation for walking and cycling profiles.
- Started invalidating passed alternatives conditionally on the fork structure.
- Started using offline router if server returns 404 or 403.
-  Increased the distance at which the navigator discards passed alternative route in `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver#onRouteAlternatives`. This reduces the chance of discarding alternative routes to which a driver deviated from the primary route.
- Fixed a possible native crash in `ElectronicHorizonObserver` on application exit.
- Fixed redundant memory usage for onboard router.
- Fixed inconsistent choice between re-route and switching to alternative due to the fact that the alternative was not checked on every off-route state. 
- Fixed a crash caused by segfault "wstring_convert: from_bytes" error for HTTP responses.
- Made costing algorithms using lightweight info about road graph (should improve performance).
- Switched all realtime sensitive operations onto a separate thread instead of low-prioritised background thread pool. No long status delays should happen in the future.
