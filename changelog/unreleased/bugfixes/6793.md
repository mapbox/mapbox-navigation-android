- :warning: If you're recreating the `MapboxRouteLineView` instance, for example to change the `MapboxRouteLineOptions`, make sure that your first interaction restores the state and re-applies the options by calling `MapboxRouteLineApi.getRouteDrawData` and passing the result to `MapboxRouteLineView.renderRouteDrawData`. This is a necessary change to fix an issue where `MapboxRouteLineOptions` provided in a new instance of `MapboxRouteLineView` were ignored if the style object used with `render` functions already had route line layers initialized.
