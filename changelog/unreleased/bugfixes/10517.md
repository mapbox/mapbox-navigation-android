- Fixed waypoint handling when multiple matches are returned in `MapMatchingSuccessfulResult.matches`; waypoints are now assigned to the correct match.

- ⚠️ Breaking change (preview API): removed `MapMatchingSuccessfulResult#navigationRoutes`.
  Why: the `navigationRoutes` property encouraged incorrect usage — calling
  `mapboxNavigation.setNavigationRoutes(result.navigationRoutes)` treats each
  match as an alternative route. Matches are results of map-matching and are
  not true route alternatives; passing them together will make the
  navigator accept only first route rejecting the others.
  Migration guide: select navigation route from a single match `mapboxNavigation.setNavigationRoutes(listOf(result.matches.first().navigationRoute))`.
