- `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver#onRouteAlternatives` could be called with an online alternative that is the same as current offline route except for its origin and annotations.
`MapboxNavigation#getAlternativeMetadataFor` will return null for that alternative.
Calling `MapboxNavigation#setNavigationRoutes(listOf(currentOfflinePrimaryRoute, newOnlineAlternative))` for that case won't make any effect as the alternative will be ignored.
Make sure that you implemented routes alternatives observers with respect to offline-online scenarios as documentation suggests.
