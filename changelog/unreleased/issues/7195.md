- In case a users follows an offline(onboard) route, `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver#onRouteAlternatives` could be called with an online alternative that is the same as current offline route except for its origin and annotations. `MapboxNavigation#getAlternativeMetadataFor` will return null for that alternative. If you call `MapboxNavigation#setNavigationRoutes` keeping existing offline route as primary and alternatives which is the same as an alternatives, the alternatives will be ignored. We suggest implementing routes alternatives observers with respect to offline-online scenarios.
