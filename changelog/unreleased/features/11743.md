- Added Experimental API:
  - `MapboxNavigation#registerVoiceInstructionsAvailableObserver` and `MapboxNavigation#unregisterVoiceInstructionsAvailableObserver` to be notified when voice instructions become available or unavailable;
  - `MapboxNavigation#registerRelevantVoiceInstructionsCallback` to asynchronously fetch the relevant voice instructions. The callback is automatically unregistered after receiving the result, register again for subsequent voice instructions.
