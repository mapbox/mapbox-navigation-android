- Added `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource#isFramingManeuverPropertyOverride` property to explicitly set the camera to framing-maneuver / non-framing-maneuver mode. Note that it is a delicate API and for most cases you don't need to override this property. Use this method only if you are sure that's the only way to achieve the desired behaviour.
