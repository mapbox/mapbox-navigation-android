- Added `RouteCalloutUiStateProvider` class that allows to listen to Route Callout UI data.
Normally, route callouts are drawn under the hood in NavSDK when this feature is enabled in `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions`.
However, there might be cases when app wants to only get the callout data from NavSDK and attach the DVA itself.
An example of such a case is using Mapbox Maps SDK Compose extensions: attaching a DVA for
Compose MapboxMap is done via [compose-specific API](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/examples/compose/dynamic-view-annotations/),
which is not currently supported by NavSDK.
In this case you may listen to `RouteCalloutUiStateData` updates via `RouteCalloutUiStateProvider` and use its information by attach a DVA.
