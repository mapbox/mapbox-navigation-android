- Added a `NavigationCamera` constructor that accepts `UpdateFrameAnimatorsOptions`. This allows NavSDK to execute the update frame animations in a more performant way.

By default, NavSDK supports any type of dependencies between animators in a compound frame update animation.
Meaning that center, zoom, padding, pitch and bearing animators can form any dependencies graph supported by `AnimatorSet` API.
However, this may poorly influence the performance.
If you pass `updateFrameAnimatorsOptions` with `UpdateFrameAnimatorsOptions#useSimplifiedAnimatorsDependency` set to true,
NavSDK will assume the following restrictions for update frame animations:
1. They are played together (started at the same time);
2. They don't have start delays.
Note 1: they can still be of different duration.
Note 2: this is ony relevant for update frame animations. For state transition animations (`NavigationCameraStateTransition#transitionToFollowing` and `NavigationCameraStateTransition#transitionToOverview`) no such assumptions are made.
This allows NavSDK to execute the animations in a more performant way.
If this simplified setup works for you (it's especially important to check these conditions if you use custom `NavigationCameraStateTransition`),
you can set `UpdateFrameAnimatorsOptions#useSimplifiedAnimatorsDependency`]` to true for simpler, but more optimized update frame animations.
