- Added a `NavigationCamera` constructor that accepts `UpdateFrameTransitionOptions` (only applicable if you provide custom `NavigationCameraStateTransition`).
By default Navigation SDK assumes that frame transition animations (returned by `NavigationCameraStateTransition#updateFrameForFollowing` and `NavigationCameraStateTransition#updateFrameForOverview`) are simple in a sense that: 
1. They are played together (started at the same time);
2. They don't have start delays.
Note 1: they can still be of different duration.
Note 2: this is ony relevant for update frame animations. For state transition animations (`NavigationCameraStateTransition#transitionToFollowing` and `NavigationCameraStateTransition#transitionToOverview`) no such assumptions are made.
This allows NavSDK to execute the animations in a more performant way.
However, if this is not the case for your custom update frame animations, pass `UpdateFrameTransitionOptions` to the `NavigationCamera` constructor along with your custom `NavigationCameraStateTransition` and specify this fact by setting `UpdateFrameTransitionOptions#nonSimultaneousAnimatorsDependency` to `true`.
