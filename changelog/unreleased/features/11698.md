- Added new class `RerouteStateV2`: it allows you to observe RerouteStates with additional substates which are not present in the original `RerouteState`. 
Current additional states are: `RerouteStateV2.Deviation.ApplyingRoute` and `RerouteStateV2.Deviation.RouteIgnored`. See the corresponding API reference for details.
To observe `RerouteStateV2`, register a new type of observer: `RerouteController#registerRerouteStateV2Observer`.
