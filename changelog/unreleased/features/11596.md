- Added experimental `NavigationOptions#nativeRouteObject` which replaces `NavigationRoute#directionsRoute` with a thin wrapper that accesses route data stored in native memory instead of the Java heap. This is an early preview feature. When this option is enabled, some functionality is disabled or not fully supported. See `NavigationOptions#nativeRouteObject` for details.
