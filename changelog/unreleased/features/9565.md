- Added experimental overloads for `MapboxManeuverApi#getRoadShields` and `MapboxRouteShieldApi#getRouteShields` that accept a `ShieldFontConfig` parameter, enabling custom font selection for route shields.
- Added experimental `MapboxNavigationSVGExternalFileResolver` that can resolve fonts for SVG rendering from assets or use system fonts.
