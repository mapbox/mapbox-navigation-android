- Added `RoadComponent.language` value.
- :warning: Changed `EHorizonEdgeMetadata.names` class from `RoadName` to `RoadComponent`.
  To migrate change your code from:
```kotlin
val shielded = roadName.shielded
```
into:
```kotlin
val shielded = roadComponent.shield != null
```
- Added support for continuous EV alternatives in `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver`.
- Fixed issues with map-matching to HOV-only roads.
- Set a limit of simultaneously running onboard route requests to avoid too many tasks blocking too much of the device's computing resources.
- Fixed an issue with Road Access Policy ignoring the setting to map-match to closed road sections, when enabled.
