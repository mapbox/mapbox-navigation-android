- `RoadCamerasManager` in active guidance now relies on new `road_camera` Directions API annotation, which improves the performance of the camera data retrieval and quality of the data.
- Added `MapboxRoadCamera::activeGuidanceInfo`, containing information about the route id, leg index, geometry index and step intersection of the camera in active guidance.
