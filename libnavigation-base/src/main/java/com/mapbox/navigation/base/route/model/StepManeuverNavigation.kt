 * @since 1.0
 *
 * @property bearingAfter Number between 0 and 360 indicating the clockwise angle from true north
 * to the direction of travel right after the maneuver.
 * @since 1.0
 *
 * @property instruction A human-readable instruction of how to execute the returned maneuver. This String is built
 * using OSRM-Text-Instructions and can be further customized inside either the Mapbox Navigation
 * SDK for Android or using the OSRM-Text-Instructions.java project in Project-OSRM.
 * @see [Navigation SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android)
 * @see [OSRM-Text-Instructions.java](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.java)
 * @since 1.0
 *
 * @property type This indicates the type of maneuver.
 * @see StepManeuverTypeNavigation
 * @since 1.0
 *
 * @property modifier This indicates the mode of the maneuver. If type is of turn, the modifier indicates the
 * change in direction accomplished through the turn. If the type is of depart/arrive, the
 * modifier indicates the position of waypoint from the current direction of travel.
 * @since 1.0
 *
 * @property exit An optional integer indicating number of the exit to take. If exit is undefined the destination
 * is on the roundabout. The property exists for the following type properties:
 *
 * else - indicates the number of intersections passed until the turn.
 * roundabout - traverse roundabout
 * rotary - a traffic circle
