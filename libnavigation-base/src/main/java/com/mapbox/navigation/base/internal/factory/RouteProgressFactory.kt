     * @param route [DirectionsRoute] the navigation session is currently using. When a reroute occurs and a new
     * directions route gets obtained, with the next location update this directions route should
     * reflect the new route.
     * @param bannerInstructions [BannerInstructions] current instructions for visual guidance.
     * @param voiceInstructions [VoiceInstructions] current instruction for audio guidance.
     * @param currentState [RouteProgressState] the current state of progress along the route.
     * Provides route and location tracking information.
     * @param currentLegProgress [RouteLegProgress] current progress of the active leg, includes
     * time and distance estimations.
     * @param upcomingStepPoints [List][Point] location coordinates describing the upcoming step.
     * @param inTunnel [Boolean] value indicating whether the current location is in a tunnel.
     * @param distanceRemaining [Float] provides the distance remaining in meters until the user
     * reaches the end of the route.
     * @param distanceTraveled [Float] representing the distance traveled along the route in meters.
     * @param durationRemaining [Double] seconds time remaining until the route destination is reached.
     * @param fractionTraveled [Float] fraction traveled along the current route. This value is
     * between 0 and 1 and isn't guaranteed to reach 1 before the user reaches the end of the route.
     * @param remainingWaypoints [Int] number of waypoints remaining on the current route.
     * @param upcomingRoadObjects list of upcoming road objects.
     * @param stale `true` if there were no location updates for a significant amount which causes
     * a lack of confidence in the progress updates being sent.
