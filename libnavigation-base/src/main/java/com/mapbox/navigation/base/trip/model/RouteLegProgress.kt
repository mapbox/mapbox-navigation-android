/**
 * This is a progress object specific to the current leg the user is on. If there is only one leg
 * in the directions route, much of this information will be identical to the parent
 * [RouteProgress].
 *
 * The latest route leg progress object can be obtained through the [RouteProgressObserver].
 * Note that the route leg progress object's immutable.
 *
 * @param legIndex Index representing the current leg the user is on. If the directions route currently in use
 * contains more then two waypoints, the route is likely to have multiple legs representing the
 * distance between the two points.
 * @param routeLeg [RouteLeg] geometry
 * @param distanceTraveled Total distance traveled in meters along current leg
 * @param distanceRemaining The distance remaining in meters until the user reaches the end of the leg
 * @param durationRemaining The duration remaining in seconds until the user reaches the end of the current step
 * @param fractionTraveled The fraction traveled along the current leg, this is a float value between 0 and 1 and
 * isn't guaranteed to reach 1 before the user reaches the next waypoint
 * @param currentStepProgress [RouteStepProgress] object with information about the particular step the user
 * is currently on
 * @param upcomingStep Next/upcoming step immediately after the current step. If the user is on the last step
 * on the last leg, this will return null since a next step doesn't exist
 * @param geometryIndex Leg-wise index representing the geometry point that starts the segment
 * the user is currently on, effectively this represents the index of last visited geometry point in the leg.
 * @param legDestination the waypoint that marks the end of the current leg.
