/**
 * This class contains all progress information at any given time during a navigation session. This
 * progress includes information for the current route, leg, and step that the user is traveling along.
 * With every new valid location update, a new route progress will be generated using the latest
 * information.
 *
 * The latest route progress object can be obtained through the [com.mapbox.navigation.core.trip.session.RouteProgressObserver].
 * Note that the route progress object's immutable.
 *
 * @param route [DirectionsRoute] the navigation session is currently using. When a reroute occurs and a new
 * directions route gets obtained, with the next location update this directions route should
 * reflect the new route.
 * @param routeGeometryWithBuffer [Geometry] of the current [DirectionsRoute] with a buffer
 * that encompasses visible tile surface are while navigating. This [Geometry] is ideal
 * for offline downloads of map or routing tile data.
 * @param bannerInstructions [BannerInstructions] current instructions for visual guidance.
 * @param voiceInstructions [VoiceInstructions] current instruction for audio guidance.
 * @param currentState [RouteProgressState] the current state of progress along the route.
 * Provides route and location tracking information.
 * @param currentLegProgress [RouteLegProgress] current progress of the active leg, includes
 * time and distance estimations.
 * @param upcomingStepPoints [List][Point] location coordinates describing the upcoming step.
 * @param inTunnel [Boolean] value indicating whether the current location is in a tunnel.
 * @param distanceRemaining [Float] provides the distance remaining in meters until the user
 * reaches the end of the route.
 * @param distanceTraveled [Float] representing the distance traveled along the route in meters.
 * @param durationRemaining [Double] seconds time remaining until the route destination is reached.
 * @param fractionTraveled [Float] fraction traveled along the current route. This value is
 * between 0 and 1 and isn't guaranteed to reach 1 before the user reaches the end of the route.
 * @param remainingWaypoints [Int] number of waypoints remaining on the current route.
