## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.5.0-beta.1 - April 22, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.5.0-alpha.3 and v2.5.0-beta.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.5.0-alpha.3...v2.5.0-beta.1)

#### Features
- Added support for excluding maneuvers from the 'pitch to 0' camera updates when `FollowingFrameOptions#pitchNearManeuvers` is enabled. See `FollowingFrameOptions#pitchNearManeuvers#excludedManeuvers`. [#5717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5717)
- :warning: Navigation Camera will no longer animate to `pitch 0` when approaching following maneuvers: "continue", "merge", "on ramp", "off ramp" and "fork". Original behavior can be restored by setting an empty list to `FollowingFrameOptions#pitchNearManeuvers#excludedManeuvers`.

#### Bug fixes and improvements

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.5.0-alpha.3 - April 15, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.5.0-alpha.2 and v2.5.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.5.0-alpha.2...v2.5.0-alpha.3)

#### Features
- Added `MapboxNavigation#setTripNotificationInterceptor` to allow for notification customizations. This makes the notification compatible with the `CarAppExtender`. [#5669](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5669)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Added `NavigationOptions#EHorizonOptions#AlertServiceOptions` which allow to control which road objects are picked up from the eHorizon graph. :warning: Since Restricted Areas can be resource intensive to pick up, they are now disabled by default. [#5693](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5693)
- Fixed an issue where a call to `MapboxNavigation#stopTripSession` would clear the routes reference and led to a `RoutesObserver` notification with empty routes collection. [#5685](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5685)
- Fixed an issue where `AlternativeRouteMetadata` would get cleared after route refresh (whenever routes update reason was `RoutesExtra#ROUTES_UPDATE_REASON_REFRESH`). [#5691](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5691)
- Fixed a race condition where internal route refresh logic could overwrite the result of a call to `MapboxNavigation#setRoutes`. [#5685](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5685)

#### Known issues
- Adding a custom `Logger` instance by [replacing the default logger module](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/guides/get-started/modularization/#logger) causes a runtime exception during library loading.

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.4.0 - April 14, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.4.0 and v2.3.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0)

- :exclamation: Starting with version 2.4 (2.4.0-beta.3), we are implementing a grace period of 30-seconds for all navigation sessions started by Nav SDK. A session will be counted only after this time period has surpassed. This allows you to reduce the cost of using the SDK during development and testing of your applications, as well as in production. Grace period is especially helpful to decrease the cost of short Free Drive session that are just a transition between Active Guidance sessions, or when a session is aborted right after it was started.
- :warning: Deprecated `RouterOrigin.Custom(obj: Any?)`. The SDK doesn't keep `RouteOrigin.Custom#obj` anymore, it always becomes `null` when the `obj` returns in `RoutesObserver`. [#5500](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5500)
- :warning: Restricted Areas are intentionally not being picked up from the eHorizon graph in Free Drive as the operation can be very resource intensive. An option to re-enable this feature will be exposed in future releases.

#### Features
- Introduced a `NavigationRoute` object and related functions like `NavigationRouterCallback`, `MapboxNavigation#setNavigationRoutes`, etc. `NavigationRoute` is a domain specific wrapper on top of `DirectionsRoute` which provides information (and enforces its presence) about the original `DirectionsResponse` that this route is part of, as well as what `RouteOptions` were used to generate it.
  Most of the Navigation SDK APIs that rely only on `DirectionsRoute` are now marked as `Deprecated` since there might be features introduced in the future that would require the `NavigationRoute` instances instead.
  There are `NavigationRoute#toDirectionsRoute()` and `DirectionsRoute#toNavigationRoute()` compatibility extensions available, however, the latter is lossy since `DirectionsRoute` cannot carry as much information as `NavigationRoute` and the recommended migration path is to use `NavigationRouterCallback` instead of the old `RouterCallback` to request routes.
  This change might require action when integrating if you have hardcoded routes in your test suites that do not have all necessary fields to support `DirectionsRoute` to `NavigationRoute` mapping (mostly `DirectionsRoute#routeIndex`) - in these cases make sure to provide the missing data or regenerate the routes using `MapboxNavigation#requestRoutes`.
  [#5411](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5411)
- Added a new `RailwayCrossing` type to `RoadObject`s. [#5552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5552)
- Added point exclusion option for onboard router. [#5552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5552)
- Improved capabilities to replay route alternatives with the `ReplayProgressObserver` by respecting the current distance traveled. This fixes the jump to the beginning of the alternative route upon the switch. [#5586](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5586)
- Added extension functions for overriding the route line traffic expression or color. [#5597](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5597)
- Added `RerouteOptionsAdapter`. It allows to modify `RouteOptions` on reroute for default implementation of `RerouteController` via `MapboxNavigation#setRerouteOptionsAdapter`. [#5573](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5573)
- Added `LocationMatcherResult#isDegradedMapMatching` which allows to understand if current matched location was produced using limited map matching approach(e.g. due to lack of map data). [#5606](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5606)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Added `MapboxNavigationApp.setup` overload, that accepts `NavigationOptionsProvider` instead of prebuilt `NavigationOptions`. [#5490](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5490)
- Fixed `MapboxNavigationApp` issue, that caused unexpected `MapboxNavigation` destroy, when one of the attached lifecycles is destroyed and the other one is stopped. [#5518](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5518)
- Fixed uncaught exception in the `ShieldsCache` class. [#5524](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5524)
- Use native logger backend instead of the Android instance directly. [#5520](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5520)
- Fixed an issue where a route refresh would only refresh annotations for the current leg of a route instead of for all remaining legs of a route. [#5552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5552)
- Fixed an issue where alternative routes would hold a reference to the original route's `RouteOptions` instead of the correct ones that were used to generate the alternative. [#5552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5552)
- Fixed an issue related to highlighting buildings via the MapboxBuildingsApi by adding the building-extrusion layer as one of the layers queried. [#5433](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5433)
- Adopted Common SDK log messages parsing logic so it's consistent across Mapbox SDKs. As an example, this is how the logs would look like `D/Mapbox: [nav-sdk] [ConnectivityHandler] NetworkStatus=ReachableViaWiFi`. [#5604](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5604)
- Added a workaround for [`ConnectivityManager`'s occasional security exception on Android 11 and older](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/175055271). [#5587](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5587)
- Fixed an issue where off-route wouldn't be reported if we were navigating in a fallback mode (without routing tiles on device). [#5587](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5587)
- `RouteProgressState#INITIALIZED` might now be reported for each leg start, not only for the route start. [#5587](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5587)
- Fixed `HistoryEventMapper#mapNavigationRoute` for when `SetRouteHistoryRecord` has empty `routeRequest`. [#5614](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5614)
- Fixed an issue where route refresh failure led to a parsing error and runtime crash instead of failure callback. [#5617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5617)
- Fixed `ReplayRouteInterpolator` speed adjustment on turns. A driver doesn't slow down on minor curvatures on a motorway. [5618](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5618)
- Fixed an issue where line `RoadObject`s matched with `RoadObjectMatcher` which consisted of only one edge and multiple lines where calculated incorrectly. [#5629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5629)
- Moved alternative route line processing to a worker thread, relieving a little bit of load from the main thread during each recalculation. [#5634](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5634)
- Added `AsyncAudioFocusDelegate` to `MapboxVoiceInstructionsPlayer` to allow clients to interact with the audio focus in an asynchronous way. [#5652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5652)
- Added `AudioFocusOwner` so that the owner can be specified when requesting the audio focus `AsyncAudioFocusDelegate#requestFocus`. [#5652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5652)
- Added `ttsStreamType` to `VoiceInstructionsPlayerOptions` so that the stream type for playing TTS can be specified, allowing to fix an issue with `KEY_PARAM_STREAM` not being updated and used properly. Defaults to `AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC`. [#5652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5652)
- Fixed an issue found in `v2.4.0-beta.3` and later where compressed tiles were incorrectly decoded from the cache. This could have led to degraded map matching or unavailable resources. [#5707](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5707)

### Mapbox dependencies
This release depends on, and has been tested with, the following Mapbox dependencies:
- Mapbox Maps SDK `v10.4.2` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android/releases/tag/android-v10.4.2))
- Mapbox Navigation Native `v94.0.3`
- Mapbox Core Common `v21.2.1`
- Mapbox Java `v6.4.0` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/releases/tag/v6.4.0))
- Mapbox Android Core `v5.0.1`
- Mapbox Android Telemetry `v8.1.1`

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.5.0-alpha.2 - April 7, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.5.0-alpha.1 and v2.5.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.5.0-alpha.1...v2.5.0-alpha.2)

#### Features
- Exposed `MapboxNavigation#getAlternativeMetadataFor` function which returns metadata associated with alternative routes that are tracked in the current navigation session. This metadata can be used with `MapboxRouteLineApi#setNavigationRoutes` to hide portions of the alternative routes until their deviation point with the primary route. This is especially helpful in preventing alternative routes from resurfacing under the puck if the vanishing route line feature is enabled. [#5653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5653)
- Exposed `NavigationRoute#id` and `RouteProgress#routeAlternativeId` which together can be used to immediately find an alternative route that a user might've turned into and generated an off-route event. [#5653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5653)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Improved reroute experience for a default controller. `MapboxRerouteController` now immediately switches to an alternative route when a user turns to it, without making an unnecessary route request. [#5645](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5645)
- Added `AsyncAudioFocusDelegate` to `MapboxVoiceInstructionsPlayer` to allow clients to interact with the audio focus in an asynchronous way. [#5652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5652)
- Added `AudioFocusOwner` so that the owner can be specified when requesting the audio focus `AsyncAudioFocusDelegate#requestFocus`. [#5652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5652)
- Added `ttsStreamType` to `VoiceInstructionsPlayerOptions` so that the stream type for playing TTS can be specified, allowing to fix an issue with `KEY_PARAM_STREAM` not being updated and used properly. Defaults to `AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC`. [#5652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5652)
- Made all reachable polygon entries and exits tracked instead of the closest one for E-horizon `RoadObject`s. [#5653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5653)
- Fixed an issue where enhanced location couldn't snap to correct road edge for a long time after leaving a tunnel. [#5653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5653)
- Fixed `MapboxSpeedLimitView` sizing when rendering `UpdateSpeedLimitError` value [#5666](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5666)

#### Other changes
- Up until this point, `RoutesObserver` fired nearly immediately with new route references after `MapboxNavigation@setNavigationRoutes` was called. Now, the Nav SDK first fully processes the routes (for example, to compute the `AlternativeRouteMetadata`) which results in a small delay between routes being set and actually returned by the `RoutesObserver`.

#### Known issues
- Occasionally, the first `RouteProgress` update after setting new route might fail to be delivered due to the scheduling of route processing jobs.
- When alternative routes that take advantage of the `AlternativeRouteMetadata` are reset because new become available, or changed manually by interacting with the map, there could be a brief flash of the full alternative route geometry which quickly recovers to a valid state.
- Calling `MapboxNavigation#stopTripSession` clears the routes reference and leads to a `RoutesObserver` notification with empty routes collection.

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- :warning: Realigned all `NavigationCamera` transitions to not fallback to `Idle` if a transition is canceled to keep the behavior consistent and predictable (state transitions used to be cancelable while frame transitions weren't). If you need the `NavigationCamera` to reset to `Idle` on external interactions or cancellations, use `NavigationBasicGesturesHandler` or `NavigationScaleGestureHandler` [#5607](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5607)

- Fixed an issue where `RouteProgress` might not have been delivered in active guidance when `MapboxNavigation#setRoutes` calls were dispatched in quick succession (session was locked in an invalid state). [#5629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5629)
- Improved the time between the router getting access to a raw Directions API response and Nav SDK delivering a `NavigationRoute` instance in `NavigationRouterCallback`. [#5629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5629)
- Fixed an issue where line `RoadObject`s matched with `RoadObjectMatcher` which consisted of only one edge and multiple lines where calculated incorrectly. [#5629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5629)

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.4.0-beta.3 - March 25, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.4.0-beta.2 and v2.4.0-beta.3](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.4.0-beta.2...v2.4.0-beta.3)

- :exclamation: Starting with version 2.4 (2.4.0-beta.3), we are implementing a grace period of 30-seconds for all navigation sessions started by Nav SDK. A session will be counted only after this time period has surpassed. This allows you to reduce the cost of using the SDK during development and testing of your applications, as well as in production. Grace period is especially helpful to decrease the cost of short Free Drive session that are just a transition between Active Guidance sessions, or when a session is aborted right after it was started.

#### Features
- Added `RerouteOptionsAdapter`. It allows to modify `RouteOptions` on reroute for default implementation of `RerouteController` via `MapboxNavigation#setRerouteOptionsAdapter`. [#5573](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5573)

- :warning: `NavigationRoute`'s constructor has been hidden in favor of `NavigationRoute#create` static factories. [#5587](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5587)
- Added a workaround for [`ConnectivityManager`'s occasional security exception on Android 11 and older](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/175055271). [#5587](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5587)

- Added extension functions for overriding the route line traffic expression or color. [#5597](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5597)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Fixed an issue where a route refresh would only refresh annotations for the current leg of a route instead of for all remaining legs of a route. [#5552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5552)
- Fixed an issue where alternative routes would hold a reference to the original route's `RouteOptions` instead of the correct ones that were used to generate the alternative. [#5552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5552)
- Fixed an issue related to highlighting buildings via the MapboxBuildingsApi by adding the building-extrusion layer as one of the layers queried. [#5433](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5433)

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.4.0-alpha.1 - February 24, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.3.0-rc.3 and v2.4.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.3.0-rc.3...v2.4.0-alpha.1)

#### Features
- Introduced a `NavigationRoute` object and related functions like `NavigationRouterCallback`, `MapboxNavigation#setNavigationRoutes`, etc. `NavigationRoute` is a domain specific wrapper on top of `DirectionsRoute` which provides information (and enforces its presence) about the original `DirectionsResponse` that this route is part of, as well as what `RouteOptions` were used to generate it.
  Most of the Navigation SDK APIs that rely only on `DirectionsRoute` are now marked as `Deprecated` since there might be features introduced in the future that would require the `NavigationRoute` instances instead.
  There are `NavigationRoute#toDirectionsRoute()` and `DirectionsRoute#toNavigationRoute()` compatibility extensions available, however, the latter is lossy since `DirectionsRoute` cannot carry as much information as `NavigationRoute` and the recommended migration path is to use `NavigationRouterCallback` instead of the old `RouterCallback` to request routes.
  This change might require action when integrating if you have hardcoded routes in your test suites that do not have all necessary fields to support `DirectionsRoute` to `NavigationRoute` mapping (mostly `DirectionsRoute#routeIndex`) - in these cases make sure to provide the missing data or regenerate the routes using `MapboxNavigation#requestRoutes`.
  [#5411](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5411)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Added `MapboxNavigationApp.setup` overload, that accepts `NavigationOptionsProvider` instead of prebuilt `NavigationOptions`. [#5490](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5490)

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.2.1 - January 24, 2022
### Changelog
[Changes between v2.2.0 and v2.2.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1):

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Fixed an issue where the _Onboard_ Router (used in offline scenarios) couldn't dispatch routes with tiles versions after and including `2021_12_25-03_00_00`.

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.2.0 - January 20, 2022

For details on how v2 differs from v1 and guidance on migrating from v1 of the Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android to the v2 public preview, see [2.0 Navigation SDK Migration Guide](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/2.0-Navigation-SDK-Migration-Guide).

### Known issues
- :exclamation: The _Onboard_ Router (used in offline scenarios) can't dispatch routes with tiles versions after and including `2021_12_25-03_00_00`. If a tiles version is left unspecified, Navigation SDK will download the latest version. Therefore, in order to work around this, the tiles version needs to be manually specified to any version before `2021_12_25-03_00_00` (e.g. `2021_02_14-03_00_00`). This can be done specifying the tiles version in the routing tiles options `RoutingTilesOptions#tilesVersion` and adding those options to the navigation options `NavigationOptions#routingTilesOptions`.

### Changelog
[Changes between v2.1.2 and v2.2.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/compare/v2.1.2...v2.2.0):

#### Features
- Added support for Mapbox designed route shields. [#5145](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5145)
    - To access the newly introduced `MapboxRouteShieldApi` independently of the `MapboxManeuverApi`, add the dependency to your project:
      ```
      implementation "com.mapbox.navigation:ui-shields:{nav_sdk_version}"
      ```
- Added methods in `MapboxRouteLineView` to change the visibility of the route traffic layers. [#5283](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5283)
#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Exposed `ManeuverExitOptions`, `ManeuverPrimaryOptions`, `ManeuverSecondaryOptions`, `ManeuverSubOptions`, `MapboxExitProperties` to define the style for `MapboxPrimaryManeuver`, `MapboxSecondaryManeuver`, `MapboxSubManeuver` and associated `MapboxExitText` for each of these maneuvers. [#5357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5357)
- Refactored the exit text logic to handle the drawable size based on the size of text associated in `MapboxExitText`. [#5357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5357)
- Deprecated `MapboxRoadNameLabelView` and introduced `MapboxRoadNameView` to render mapbox designed shields in the current road name label. [#5310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5310)
- Fixed an issue where calculation of dangerous maneuver avoidance (`RerouteOptions#avoidManeuverSeconds`) during a reroute was resulting in much smaller radius than expected. [#5307](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5307)

### Changelog
#### Bug fixes and improvements
- :warning: The Mapbox Electronic Horizon feature of the Mapbox Navigation SDK is in public beta and is subject to changes, including its pricing. Use of the feature is subject to the beta product restrictions in the Mapbox Terms of Service. Mapbox reserves the right to eliminate any free tier or free evaluation offers at any time and require customers to place an order to purchase the Mapbox Electronic Horizon feature, regardless of the level of use of the feature. [#4985](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4985)
- Removed deprecated method from `RouteOptionsUpdater`. [#4970](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4970)
- Added a new `Road` object that can be obtained thorough `LocationMatcherResult`. [#4972](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4972)

- Removed unused `NavigationOption#isFromNavigationUi` option. [#5019](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5019)
- Updated standalone components, so that they are no longer tied to `MapboxNavigation` lifecycle. Warning: when such a component is no longer in use, its `cancel` or equivalent function should be called in order to avoid leaks. [#5031](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5031)
- Fixed clear `VoiceInstructionsTextPlayer` `currentPlay` when `shutdown`. [#5032](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5032)
- Changed the `iconKeepUpright` parameter for the layer hosting the waypoints is set to `true` to address issue with some custom icons that may be intended to appear like 3D pins. [#5047](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/5047)

#### Known issues
- `RouteAlternativesObserver#onRouteAlternatives` always reports `RouterOrigin` as `Onboard` even if the results are coming from the offboard router. This is can be tracked in [#5127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/issues/5127).
- Taking an alternative route (by turning into it instead of selecting manually) triggers a reroute. This is can be tracked in [#5039](ttps://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/issues/5039).

- :warning: Changed `MapboxManeuverApi#getManeuvers(route, callback, routeLeg)` to `MapboxManeuverApi#getManeuvers(route, callback, routeLegIndex)` to provide better support for various scenarios. This also fixed a bug where `MapboxManeuverApi` was not producing any more updates after the original route's annotations were refreshed. [#4607](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4607)
- :warning: Removed `ManevuerCallback` since it was called back synchronously anyway. `MapboxManeuverApi#getManeuvers` returns the results directly now. [#4609](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4609)
- Minor performance improvements in the drawing of the route line. Laying out traffic on top of the route is now decoupled from drawing the route itself, which decreases the time in which the core of the route line is first visible. [#4292](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4292)
- Fixed a `ConcurrentModificationException` that could occasionally be thrown when `PredictiveCacheController` was used and the connectivity changed between online/offline. [#4605](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4605)

### Changelog
#### Features
- Added missing `IncidentInfo` properties: `countryCodeAlpha2`, `countryCodeAlpha3`, `lanesBlocked`, `longDescription`, `lanesClearDesc`, `numLanesBlocked`. [#4569](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4569)
- :warning: Refactored `MapboxManeuverApi` to return a list of maneuvers asynchronously without the road shields and either for a raw route reference or for route progress. See `MapboxManeuverApi#getManeuvers` and `MapboxManeuverView#renderManeuvers` for details. [#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4482)
- Refactored road shield downloader to make it more efficient. [#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4482)
- Added options to the `RouteArrowOptions` class for customizing the scaling expressions used for maneuver arrows. [#4551](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4551)
- Added new `HistoryEvent`: `HistoryEventPushHistoryRecord` allows read events set with **type**-**properties** structure. [#4567](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4567)
- :warning: Added new APIs to request and render road shields asynchronously, see `MapboxManeuverApi#getRoadShields` and `MapboxManeuverView#renderManeuverShields` for details. Shields are not automatically downloaded anymore to allow for more granular and faster initial updates. [#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4482)
- Exposed `RouteStepProgress#instructionIndex` that indicates which instruction out of the list of instructions for a step is the currently active one. [#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4482)
- :warning: Refactored `PredictiveCacheController` to handle multiple map instances, add the ability to filter sources to cache. [#4539](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4539)
    - `fun setMapInstance(map: MapboxMap)` is replaced with `fun addMapInstance(map: MapboxMap,  sourceIdsToCache: List<String>)` to allow for more granular caching configuration and support multiple map instances at the same time.
    - `fun removeMapInstance()` is replaced with `fun removeMapInstance(map: MapboxMap)`.
    - `predictiveCacheLocationOptions: PredictiveCacheLocationOptions` is moved from `NavigationOptions` to `PredictiveCacheController`.
    -  Note: the map instance has to be configured with the same `TileStore` instance that was provided to `RoutingTilesOptions.tileStore` to best support predictive caching and offline features.

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Fixed a bug where in some cases status updates were not generated after switching between offline and online states. [#4558](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4558)
- Fixed an issue where `RouteOptions` weren't appended to onboard router results which could've caused incorrect reroutes that missed silent waypoints or other waypoint modifiers. [#4563](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4563)
- Refactored dependency of `libnavui-resources` by changing from api to implementation. [#4568](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4568)
- :warning: `RouteProgress#bannerInstructions` does not become `null` and keeps its reference for as long as a step is active. Listen to `BannerInstructionsObserver` if you need a specific timing event when the banner first appears. [#4482](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4482)

### Mapbox dependencies

### Changelog
#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Navigation SDK now respects the `OfflineSwitch` and will not make resource requests if the `setMapboxStackConnected` is set to `false`, it will use cached resources and immediately fallback to local generation of routes, even if connectivity is available. [#4529](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4529)
- `RoadObjectMatcher` API changed. Added `cancelAll()` func, added `onMatchingCancelled(id: String)` callback to a `RoadObjectMatcherListener`, `cancel(roadObjectIds: List<String>)` handles a list of ids, not a single one. [#4542](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4542)
- Migrated to callback-based native getStatus approach. [#4419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4419)
- Removed `routeGeometryWithBuffer` from `RouteProgress`. [#4419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4419)
- :warning: Internal `setUnconditionalPollingPatience` and `setUnconditionalPollingInterval` have been moved to `InternalUtils` `object` and have to be called _before_ `MapboxNavigation` is instantiated to actually take effect. [#4419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4419)

- Restored an option to display restricted sections of a route on the route line.  The option is included in the `MapboxRouteLineOptions` as `displayRestrictedRoadSections()`. The option is false by default indicating the restricted section will not be visible on the route line. [#4501](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4501)
- Navigation SDK now respects the `NetworkConnectivity` settings and will not make resource request if the `setMapboxStackConnected` is set to `false`, it will use cached resources and immediately fallback to local generation of routes, even if connectivity is available.

### Changelog
#### Bug fixes and improvements
* Removed `getRouteGeometryWithBuffer` API from `RouteProgress`. [#4478](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4478)
* Removed the `updatePrimaryRoute` method from the `MapboxRouteLineApi` class. Instead, `MapboxRouteLineApi::setRoutes` should be used. The first `DirectionsRoute` in the collection will be considered the primary route. [#4467](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4467)
* Added NavigationVersionSwitchObserver which enables listening to navigation tiles version switch. [#4451](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4451)
* Added missing `@JvmOverloads` to `MapboxNavigation#postUserFeedback` API. [#4472](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4472)
* Fixed an issue where routing tiles were not downloading correctly if the `TileStore` instance was not provided and `mapbox_access_token` string resource was not present. This was resulting in a lack of free drive events and location enhancement failures. [#4464](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4464)
* Removed `com.mapbox.navigation.ui.base.model.Expected` in favor of `com.mapobox.bindgen.Expected`. [#4463](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4463)

### Changelog
#### Features
* Added `TileStore` to the `RoutingTilesOptions` [#4408](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4408)
* Added ability to periodically observe route alternatives. [#4375](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4375)
* Deleted `FasterRouteObserver` in favor of `RouteAlternativesObserver` and `RouteAlternativesOptions`. [#4375](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4375)
* Exposed `com.mapbox.bindgen.Expected#fold`, `com.mapbox.bindgen.Expected#map`, and other mapping functions. [#4417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4417)
* Removed `Expected<E, V> ExpectedFactory#createValue()` and replaced it with `Expected<E, None> ExpectedFactory#createNone()` which means that value can never be `null` and improves consumption from Kotlin. [#4417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4417)
* Removed `RouteProgressState.ROUTE_INVALID`. `RouteProgress` will never be delivered with an invalid update, besides `RouteProgressState.OFF_ROUTE`. [#4391](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4391)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
* Hardened arrival events to trigger only when `RouteProgressState` is `ROUTE_COMPLETE` or `LOCATION_TRACKING` to avoid cases where we are uncertain/stale/rerouting but still reporting arrival. [#4392](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4392)
* Converted SAM interfaces into Functional (SAM) interfaces [#4406](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4406)
* Swapped the `com.mapbox.bindgen.Expected` generic params from `<Value, Error>` to `<Error, Value>` to match platform conventions. [#4417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4417)
* Fixed either show sub banner or lane guidance. [#4413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4413)
* Fixed the race condition in `RouteRefreshController` where `setRoute` will not cancel old refresh requests. [#4421](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4421)
* Fixed rotation angle to 0 on `MapboxManeuverTurnIcon` for regular turns. [#4423](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4423)
* Changed terminology used for route arrow border for correctness and consistency. [#4428](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4428)
* Removed the `ROUTE_` prefix from `RouteProgressState` values and updated the documentation. [#4391](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4391)
* Moved the `RouteProgressState.LOCATION_STALE` to `RouteProgress.stale`. [#4391](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4391)

* Added ability to change the text appearance for primary, secondary and total step distance of upcoming maneuver instructions. ([#4378](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4378))
* Added params to `VoiceInstructionsPlayerOptions`. ([#4373](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4373))
* Added a parser that parses svg to bitmap for signboards. ([#4335](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4335))
* Introduced `MapboxExternalFileResolver` that helps you to resolve fonts for signboards. You can now inject your own resolver as well if you don't wish to use the default. ([#4335](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4335))

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Refactored `TilesetDescriptorFactory`. ([#4364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4364))
- Updated `EHorizon` API and refactored `RoadObject`:
  - Moved all `EHorizon` and `RoadObject` **`data classes`** to `base` module. ([#4364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4364))
  - Made all the constructors `internal`. ([#4364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4364))
  - Exposed `RoadObjectInstaceFactory` and `EHorizonInstanceFactory` that lives under an `internal` package in the `base` module, which is only there for the `core` module to access it. ([#4364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4364))
* :warning: Requesting a route via `MapboxNavigation#requestRoutes` does not automatically append any defaults. Defaults are now available under these extensions:
  - `RouteOptions.Builder.applyDefaultNavigationOptions()` that applies the options that are required for the route request to execute or otherwise recommended for the Navigation SDK and all of its features to provide the best car navigation experience.
  - `RouteOptions.Builder.applyLanguageAndVoiceUnitOptions(context: Context)` that applies the options that adapt the returned instructions' language and voice unit based on the device's `Locale`.
The extensions are very much recommended to be called when building the `RouteOptions` object and then tweaked for a specific use case. ([#4320](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4320))
* Changed `VoiceInstructionsPlayerAttributes` to `sealed class`. ([#4373](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4373))
* Bug fix for calculating mutli-leg routes with traffic congestion changes or restrictions at the first point of a route leg. ([#4383](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4383))
* `MapboxSignboardAPI` now returns `Bitmap` instead of `ByteArray`. ([#4335](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4335))
* `MapboxJunctionAPI` now returns `Bitmap` instead of `ByteArray`. ([#4335](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4335))

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 2.0.0-beta.8 - April 30, 2021

 For details on how v2 differs from v1 and guidance on migrating from v1 of the Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android to the v2 public preview, see [2.0 Navigation SDK Migration Guide](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/2.0-Navigation-SDK-Migration-Guide).

 ### Changelog
 #### Features
 * Refactored `AudioFocusDelegate` to a public interface and is now optional to `MapboxVoiceInstructionsPlayer`. `MediaPlayer` stream type can now be customized and results of audio focus can now be handled. [#4278](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4278)
 * Made route refresh interval configurable. [#4321](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4321)
 * Exposed `NavigationCameraTransitionOptions` via `NavigationCamera` state requests. Those options provide high-level constraints for all of the transitions that `NavigationCamera` executes and can be used to, for example, adjust the duration of the transitions. [#4332](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4332)
 #### Bug fixes and improvements
 * Removed `@JvmOverloads` from all Mapbox Views. [#4323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4323)
 * Changed where the `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSourceDebugger`'s debug layer is positioned on the map. By default, the layer will be placed on top of the stack unless a reference ID is provided. This prevents a crash that was occurring if the previously hardcoded layer ID wasn't present in the style. [#4334](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4334)
 * Fixed replay's simulated driver issue where it will nearly stop on the freeway, by normalizing bearing for speed profile calculations. [#4338](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4338)
 * Fixed an issue where the user location was incorrectly positioned in the center of the screen in the following state when the pitch was zero, `maximizeViewableRouteGeometryWhenPitchZero` was set, and no other points were available for framing. Now the user location is correctly tied to the bottom edge of the padding if that's the only geometry to frame. The flag was also renamed to `maximizeViewableGeometryWhenPitchZero`. [#4343](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4343)

 ### Mapbox dependencies

* Add building highlight on arrival [#4078](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4078)
* Add EHorizon isOneWay property [#4295](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4295)
#### Bug fixes and improvements
* Bug fix for route line related concurrent modification of collection. [#4298](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4298)
* Made route reference checks more robust in the `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource` and improved logs to avoid situations where a route reference is mismatched and could produce incorrect frames or crash. [#4302](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4302)
* Map `ResourceOptions` contains tile store instance (TileStore API). Tile store usage is enabled by default, `ResourceOptions.tileStoreEnabled` flag is introduced to disable it. This changed the integration with the `PredictiveCacheControler` which contains update integration docs. [#4310](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4310)
* Removed Timber across SDK [#4300](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4300)
* Fixed an issue with the `NavigationCamera` occasionally spinning around when a transition to a state (typically `overview`) finished. [#4293](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4293)
* Fixed an issue with the `NavigationCamera` transitions occasionally finishing at an incorrect visual target. This could occur when a gesture interaction with the map preceded the transition. See [mapbox-maps-android/issues/277](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android/issues/277) for details and workarounds. [#4296](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4296)
* Introduced `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSourceOptions.overviewFrameOptions.geometrySimplification` which by default simplifies the route geometry used for overview framing by a factor of 25 to improve performance of frame generation, especially for longer routes. [#4286](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4286)

For details on how v2 differs from v1 and guidance on migrating from v1 of the Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android to the v2 public preview, see [2.0 Navigation SDK Migration Guide](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/2.0-Navigation-SDK-Migration-Guide).

### Changelog
#### Features
* Added a callback to the `ArrivalObserver` specifically for waypoint experiences. [#4238](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4238)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
* Refactored the route line API to improve performance. [#4271](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4271)

You can read more about details in the `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource` class documentation. [#4072](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4072)
Highlights:
    - When in the `FOLLOWING` state, the first point of the framed geometry will be placed at the bottom edge of the provided padding, centered horizontally. This typically refers to the user's location provided to the viewport data source, if available.
    - **If you use the `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSource`, you should explicitly define `CameraOptions.padding` in all other camera transitions that your app is executing.**
    - New features:
        - calculating zoom level based on intersection density
        - automatic pitching to 0 near maneuvers
        - maximizing the view of the maneuver's geometry in pitch 0
        - bearing smoothing based on the direction to the upcoming maneuver
        - `MapboxNavigationViewportDataSourceDebugger` for visualizing frames and geometries
* Fixed a bug for restricted road sections not getting cleared when calling API. [#4254](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4254)
* Set `TilesConfig` `inMemoryTileCache` size to 1GB (1024 x 1024 x 1024). [#4272](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4272)
* Fixed crash when routing new waypoints. [#4263](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4263)
* Added check if `RouteOptions` has valid UUID to refresh route. [#4260](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4260)
* Updated `ArrivalObserver` making the `onWaypointArrival` and `onFinalDestinationArrival` callbacks consistent, and can be specified through the `ArrivalController` as `ArrivalOptions`. [#4250](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4250)

## Mapbox Navigation SDK 1.0.0 - October 2, 2020
Today, we are releasing Navigation SDK (Core & UI components) v.1.0 for Android 🎉 🚀

### Core Components
This upgrade features
- a higher accuracy location engine which functions even in low GPS quality scenarios such as tunnels or overpasses,
- free-drive mode which enables accurate location positioning even without an active route for daily commuting,
- a new modular architecture that allows developers to customize the navigation experience for their use case,
- and MAUs-based billing that provides predictability in costs to developers.

### UI Components
This release as compared to legacy offers all the features but with much finer control and granularity. It mainly serves as a port of the legacy UI SDK implementation to use the `1.0` version of the Navigation SDK (Core components) and its features. The `1.0` UI Components also removes redundant methods & APIs while exposing new ones instead. It brings in new features, including:

- Two different ways of providing feedback during a trip session, thereby helping Mapbox provide better route quality, turn-by-turn experiences, traffic congestion, etc.
- Allowing developers to deemphasize portions of the route line behind the puck, thereby reflecting route progress state.
- Providing UI components that visualize a single building footprint or extrusion. Great to use for marking the final destination in an improved arrival experience.

### Pricing
Applications built with v1.0.0+ are billed based only on [monthly active users](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/monthly-active-users/), specifically ["Navigation SDKs" MAUs](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#navmaus). Navigation SDK MAUs include Directions API, Vector Tiles API, and Raster Tiles API requests with no upfront commitments or annual contracts. A Navigation SDK MAU becomes a billable event only once a user utilizes the Navigation SDK for turn-by-turn directions or for free-drive.

A single user is billed as one MAU across app upgrades as long as the app is not deleted. Deleting and re-installing an app that uses the Navigation SDK would result in an additional MAU. This happens because the SDK does not store personally identifying information.

To see the number of Navigation SDKs MAUs included in the free tier and the cost per Navigation SDKs MAU beyond the free tier, see the Navigation SDKs section of our [pricing page](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#navmaus).

### Mapbox Navigation UI SDK 1.0.0-rc.1 & Mapbox Navigation Core SDK 1.0.0-rc.5 - August 19, 2020
This version introduces a UI component of the SDK compatible with the 1.0.0 pre-release series.

The `1.0` UI SDK release as compared to legacy offers all the features but with much finer control and granularity. This version mainly serves as a port of the legacy UI SDK implementation to use the `1.0` version of the Navigation Core SDK and its features. The `1.0` UI SDK also removes redundant methods & APIs while exposing new ones instead. The SDK also brings new features, including:

- Two different ways of providing feedback during a trip session, thereby helping Mapbox provide better route quality, turn-by-turn experiences, traffic congestion, etc.

- Allowing developers to deemphasize portions of the route line behind the puck, thereby reflecting route progress state.

- Providing UI components that visualize a single building footprint or extrusion. Great to use for marking the final destination in an improved arrival experience.

Visit our [1.0.0 migration guide](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/1.0-Navigation-SDK-Migration-Guide) and the [documentation pages](http://docs.mapbox.com/android/beta/navigation/overview) for more information.

#### Changelog
Changes since the `1.0.0-rc.4` release of the Mapbox Navigation Core SDK:
* Updated Mapbox Gradle plugins and contributing docs [#3370](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3370)
* Fixed route / isOffRoute race condition which resulted in occasional missed offroute events [#3424](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3424)
* Improved the time to first banner instructions by updating data from navigator status right after a route is set [#3431](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3431)
* Updated return types, class annotations and docs, exposed route options updater [#3429](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3429)
* Bumped Kotlin version to 1.4.0 and Coroutines version to 1.3.9 [#3445](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3445)
* Fixed incorrect telemetry location timestamp format which resulted in missing feedback events [#3456](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3456)

#### Known issues
All of the issues are targeted to be resolved before this version becomes stable:
* Casing (a darker border color) of the primary route line is missing.
* Vanishing route line (deemphasizing the traveled portion of the route) can be slightly out of sync with the location puck.

### Mapbox Navigation Core SDK 1.0.0-rc.x series

This upgrade features a higher accuracy location engine which functions even in low GPS quality scenarios such as tunnels or overpasses, free-drive mode which enables accurate location positioning even without an active route for daily commuting, a new modular architecture that allows developers to customize the navigation experience for their use case, and MAUs-based billing that provides predictability in costs to developers.

Please review the [developer documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/beta/navigation/overview/#installation) to start building with the Mapbox Navigation SDK v1.0 for Android.

Already use an older version of the Navigation SDK? Check out [the migration guide](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/1.0-Navigation-SDK-Migration-Guide) to transition your project from the "legacy" core Navigation SDK to the 1.0 version.
