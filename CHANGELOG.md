### Mapbox dependencies
This release depends on, and has been tested with, the following Mapbox dependencies:
- Mapbox Maps SDK `v11.16.0-rc.1` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android/releases/tag/v11.16.0-rc.1))
- Mapbox Navigation Native `v324.16.0-rc.1`
- Mapbox Core Common `v24.16.0-rc.1`
- Mapbox Java `v7.8.0` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/releases/tag/v7.8.0))


## Navigation SDK Core Framework 3.16.0-beta.1 - 26 September, 2025
#### Notes
3.16.x is the next version after 3.12.x. For technical reasons, versions 3.13.x, 3.14.x and 3.15.x are skipped. Starting from 3.16.x, the Nav SDK minor version will be aligned with other Mapbox dependencies.

#### Features
- Added `AdasEdgeAttributes#isBuiltUpArea` and `AdasEdgeAttributes#roadItems` properties. 
- Added a new `RoadObjectMatcherOptions` class that configures the road object matching behavior. Available through the `NavigationOptions` class. 
- Added `RouteCalloutUiStateProvider` class that allows to listen to Route Callout UI data. 
Normally, route callouts are drawn under the hood in NavSDK when this feature is enabled in `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions`.
However, there might be cases when app wants to only get the callout data from NavSDK and attach the DVA itself.
An example of such a case is using Mapbox Maps SDK Compose extensions: attaching a DVA for
Compose MapboxMap is done via [compose-specific API](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/examples/compose/dynamic-view-annotations/),
which is not currently supported by NavSDK.
In this case you may listen to `RouteCalloutUiStateData` updates via `RouteCalloutUiStateProvider` and use its information by attach a DVA.
- Added experimental overloads for `MapboxManeuverApi#getRoadShields` and `MapboxRouteShieldApi#getRouteShields` that accept a `ShieldFontConfig` parameter, enabling custom font selection for route shields. 
- Added experimental `MapboxNavigationSVGExternalFileResolver` that can resolve fonts for SVG rendering from assets or use system fonts. 
- Updated `MapboxNavigation.replanRoute()` to now accept a new optional parameter of type `ReplanRoutesCallback`. 

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Fix the bug that causes road cameras on alternative routes to be marked as passed but not removed from the map. 
- Fixed the incorrect order of callbacks when notifying about road cameras on the route. 

### Mapbox dependencies
This release depends on, and has been tested with, the following Mapbox dependencies:
- Mapbox Maps SDK `v11.16.0-beta.1` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android/releases/tag/v11.16.0-beta.1))
- Mapbox Navigation Native `v324.16.0-beta.1`
- Mapbox Core Common `v24.16.0-beta.1`

## Navigation SDK Core Framework 3.12.0-beta.1 - 15 August, 2025
#### Features
- Added ability to filter by data source in EV charging station search operations. 
- Added `MapboxSpeedZoneInfo` class to represent speed zone information. Available through `UpcomingCamerasObserver::onSpeedZoneInfo` and `RoadCamerasMapCallback::onSpeedZoneInfo` callbacks. 
- Added experimental support for ADAS tiles in the predictive cache. See `PredictiveCacheNavigationOptions` for more information. 

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Optimize the `MapboxRouteArrowView` to skip re-rendering arrows that have not changed. 
- Decrased excessively high GeoJSON buffer size from 128 to 32 to improve the memory footprint. 
- Avoid unnecessary navigation arrow GeoJSON updates 
- Optimized camera animations that involve significant zoom change. 
- Fixed an issue where the closer part of route line might have been overlapped by a farther part in case they covered the same space within a single leg (e. g. U-turns on narrow roads).  
- Don't reset the re-route request when on-route/off-route events are flaky. 
- Use the `enhancedLocation` in the RoadCamerasManager class to get a more accurate current speed for the vehicle. 


### Mapbox dependencies
This release depends on, and has been tested with, the following Mapbox dependencies:
- Navigation-native `324.15.0-beta.2`
- Common SDK `24.15.0-beta.2`
- Maps SDK `11.15.0-beta.2`
- Android Search SDK `2.15.0-beta.2`

## Navigation SDK Core Framework 3.11.0-beta.1 - 04 July, 2025
#### Features
- Added support for Android 16 KB page-size devices. To consume SDK compatible with NDK 27 you need to add `-ndk27` suffix to the artifact name, for example, `com.mapbox.navigationcore:navigation` -> `com.mapbox.navigationcore:navigation-ndk27`. 
- Added method overload `TilesetDescriptorFactory#getLatest(Boolean)` that allows to specify whether to include ADAS tiles. 
- Extracted TTS functionality into a new module `audio`. 
- DR improvements - more robust models for GNSS trust, road calibration, and wheel speed trust; 
- Improve main thread utilization by removing unintended locks (visible on systems with overloaded CPU) 
- Disable the defaults for collection of tunnel/bridge subgraphs in free drive. The clients will need to specify explicitly which objects to collect via AlertServiceOptions in the public SDK interface. 
- Added support of immediate update of location puck bearing in [NavigationLocationProvider] in case of overlapping key points. 
- `RoadCamerasManager` in active guidance now relies on new `road_camera` Directions API annotation, which improves the performance of the camera data retrieval and quality of the data. 
- Added `MapboxRoadCamera::activeGuidanceInfo`, containing information about the route id, leg index, geometry index and step intersection of the camera in active guidance. 

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Fixed an issue where after a reroute the vanishing point on the route line might have been ahead of the actual vehicle's position. 
- Added `HistoryRecorderOptions#shouldRecordRouteLineEvents` property to enable/disable route line events collection for manual recording (see `CopilotOptions#shouldRecordRouteLineEvents` for the same functionality with Copilot); it is disabled by default. 
- Fixed an issue where the Speed Camera notification would appear prematurely when the car's speed was 0. 
- Fix Route replayer: normalize bearing values to be in the range of [0..360) degrees. 
- Fixed a bug where alternative routes from `RoutesUpdatedResult#ignoredRoutes` were set to `RoutesUpdatedResult#navigationRoutes` after the first route progress update. 
- Fix when already passed part of route appears behind CCP

### Mapbox dependencies
This release depends on, and has been tested with, the following Mapbox dependencies:
- Mapbox Maps SDK `v11.4.0-beta.3` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android/releases/tag/v11.4.0-beta.3))
- Mapbox Navigation Native `v308.0.0`
- Mapbox Core Common `v24.4.0-beta.3`
- Mapbox Java `v6.15.0` ([release notes](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/releases/tag/v6.15.0))


## Navigation SDK Core Framework 3.0.0 - 12 April, 2024
#### Features
- Modules structure (mostly UI components modules) has been significantly changed. See migration guide for more information https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/guides/migration-from-v2/#artifacts
- Deprecated classes, functions and fields have been removed. See [Nav SDK v2 documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/api/2.17.7/) for more information about missing parts and migration guides.
- `com.mapbox.navigation.core.reroute.NavigationRerouteController` has been merged with `com.mapbox.navigation.core.reroute.RerouteController`
- Introduced support of Mapbox Map Matching API, see `MapboxNavigation#requestMapMatching`. 
- Changed LocationOptions API. Now custom location providers that emit mocked locations are allowed. See documentation to get more information. 
- Added Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) functionality as an experimental API. 
- Added `NavigationViewApi#recenterCamera()` that allows to programatically recenter the camera position as if the recenter button was clicked. 
- Introduced support for highlighting 3D buildings.
- Navigation Core Framework doesn't let creating `NavigationRoute` from json anymore. Use `MapboxNavigation#requestRoutes` and `MapboxNavigation#requestMapMatching` to request `NavigationRoute`s.
- Changed type of `RouterOrigin`. Now it's an annotation which defines possible string values for router origin. `RouterOrigin.Offboard` is renamed to `RouterOrigin.ONLINE`, `RouterOrigin.Onboard` is renamed to `RouterOrigin.OFFLINE`, `RouterOrigin.Custom` is removed.
- Navigation Core Framework automatically updates alternative routes and switches to an online alternative in case of an offline primary route. Register `RoutesObserver` to keep track of current routes. Use `MapboxNavigation#setContinuousAlternativesEnabled` to enable/disable automatic update.
- `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver`, `RouteAlternativesObserver`, `NavigationRouteAlternativesRequestCallback`, `MapboxNavigation#registerRouteAlternativesObserver`, `MapboxNavigation#requestAlternativeRoutes` were removed in favour of automatic alternatives update.
- Added support for `RouteOptions#suppressVoiceInstructionLocalNames` to onboard router.
- Changed the semantics of `Location#timestamp` that you receive in `onLocationMatcherResult`, instead of being set to current system time it is now has location input time + lookahead (extrapolation) time.
- Route Line component has been refactored and significantly changed. See migration guide for more information: https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/guides/migration-from-v2/#mapboxroutelineapi
- Removed `LongRoutesOptimisationOptions`. Navigation Core Framework is now optimized to handle long routes by default. [#3741](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3741)
- `RouterFailure.code` has been replaced with `RouterFailure.type`. See `RouterFailureType` to find all possible error types. [#3555](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3555)
- Added "mbx.RouteLine" history events. They will be collected automatically by NavSDK for both manual recorder and Copilot recorder when the recording is started.  [#3785](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3785)
  You can enable route line events collection for Copilot using `CopilotOptions#shouldRecordRouteLineEvents` option. It is disabled by default.
- Improved EHorizon path evaluation. [#3555](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3555)
- Added experimental property `NavigationRoute#responseOriginAPI` which describes API that Navigation CF used to generate data for `NavigationRoute`. `NavigationRoute#responseOriginAPI` could be used to form expectations from navigation experience given the fact that routes with `ResponseOriginAPI.MAP_MATCHING_API` has limited support currently. [#4010](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4010)
- Public data classes have been replaces with normal classes with generated `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`. `copy` function and destructuring declarations are not available for affected classes. [#4142](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4142)
- Added support of seamless switch to an alternative route in case of deviation to the alternative route from a route received via `MapboxNavigation#requestMapMatching`. [#3972](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3972)

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Made `MapboxNavigation` constructor and `onDestroy` internal. To create an instance of `MapboxNavigation` use `MapboxNavigationProvider#create`; to destroy it use `MapboxNavigationProvider#destroy`. [3274](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation/pull/3274)
- Fixed a bug with multiple instances of cache which resulted in excessive memory consumption. 
- Fixed an issue where reroute for multi-leg routes used to fail in case waypoint_names or waypoint_targets parameters were specified without an explicit waypoint_indices parameter. 
- Improved handling of no storage available during navigation tiles downloading. 
- Improved handling of invalid config in `DeviceProfile#customConfig`. 
- Fixed a native crash in E-Horizon implementation caused by internal race condition. 
- Made `MapboxReplayer` constructor public. 
- Removed `OnlineRouteAlternativesSwitch`. Use `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver` to receive an online alternative for the current offline route. Unlike `OnlineRouteAlternativesSwitch`, `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver` doesn't switch to an online alternative automatically. 
- Changed structure of `NavigationRoute`. Now it can represent routes received from Mapbox Map Matching API as well as Mapbox Directions API.
  `NavigationRoute#directionsResponse` has been removed. Use `NavigationRoute#waypoints` and `NavigationRoute#responseUUID` to access data which used to be available via `NavigationRoute#directionsResponse`.
  `NavigationRoute#routeOptions` has been removed. Try to utilise data available in `NavigationRoute`, for example instead of using coordinates from route options, use `NavigationRoute#waypoints`. Temporary property `NavigationRoute#evMaxCharge` has been added to access maximum possible charge for the vehicle the route was requested for instead of `navigationRoute.routeOptions.getUnrecognizedProperty("ev_max_charge")`.

- Changed reroute state transition in case of deviation from a primary route which is received via `MapboxNavigation#requestMapMatching` when no alternative routes available to switch to. Reroute state used to be `Idle`, but now performs the following transition: `Idle` -> `FetchingRoute` -> `Failed` -> `Idle`. [#3972](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/3972)
- Made `RouteShieldError#url` and `RouteShieldOrigin#originalUrl` nullable. They can be null in case the request had been cancelled before the URL was formed. [#4164](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4164)
- Improved road shield rendering behaviour for long text: now the closest length-wise available icon will be downloaded, previously it had been fixed to a maximum of 6 characters. [#4164](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/pull/4164)

## Navigation SDK Core Framework 1.0.0-rc.1 - 06 February, 2024

#### Features
- Changed type of `RouterOrigin`. Now it's an annotation which defines possible string values for router origin.
- `RouterOrigin.Offboard` is renamed to `RouterOrigin.ONLINE`.
- `RouterOrigin.Onboard` is renamed to `RouterOrigin.OFFLINE`.
- `RouterOrigin.Custom` is removed.
- Navigation Core Framework automatically updates alternative routes and switches to an online alternative in case of an offline primary route. Register `RoutesObserver` to keep track of current routes. Use `MapboxNavigation#setContinuousAlternativesEnabled` to enable/disable automatic update.
- `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver`, `RouteAlternativesObserver`, `NavigationRouteAlternativesRequestCallback`, `MapboxNavigation#registerRouteAlternativesObserver`, `MapboxNavigation#requestAlternativeRoutes` were removed in favour of automatic alternatives update.
- `libnavui-voice` module has been renamed to `libnavigation-voice`. Package name has been changed to `com.mapbox.navigation.voice`.
- Added support for `RouteOptions#suppressVoiceInstructionLocalNames` to onboard router.
- Changed the semantics of `Location#timestamp` that you receive in `onLocationMatcherResult`, instead of being set to current system time it is now has location input time + lookahead (extrapolation) time.
- Implement ADASIS message batching.
- Split `MapboxRouteLineOptions` into `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions` and `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions`.
- Split `MapboxRouteLineOptions#displayRestrictedRoadSections` into `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions#calculateRestrictedRoadSections` and `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions#displayRestrictedRoadSections`. You can have a set-up where some of your `MapboxRouteLineView`s display the restricted data and others don't. Set `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions#calculateRestrictedRoadSections` if at least one of your `MapboxRouteLineView`s will display the restricted data. Set `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions#displayRestrictedRoadSections` only to those views, who are going to display it.
- Moved:
1. `MapboxRouteLineOptions.Builder#withRouteLineBelowLayerId` to `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions.Builder#routeLineBelowLayerId`;
2. `MapboxRouteLineOptions.Builder#withTolerance` to `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions.Builder#tolerance`;
3. `MapboxRouteLineOptions.Builder#withVanishingRouteLineEnabled` to `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions.Builder#vanishingRouteLineEnabled`;
4. `MapboxRouteLineOptions#styleInactiveRouteLegsIndependently`, `MapboxRouteLineOptions#vanishingRouteLineEnabled` and `MapboxRouteLineOptions#vanishingRouteLineUpdateIntervalNano` to `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions`.
5. `MapboxRouteLineOptions#softGradientTransition`, `MapboxRouteLineOptions#displaySoftGradientForTraffic`, `MapboxROuteLineOptions#shareLineGeometrySources`, `MapboxRouteLineOptions#lineDepthOcclusionFactor`, `MapboxRouteLineOptions#waypointLayerIconOffset`, `MapboxRouteLineOptions#waypointLayerIconAnchor` and `MapboxRouteLineOptions#iconPitchAlignment` to `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions`.
- Removed `RouteLineResources` class:
1. `routeLineColorResources`, `originWaypointIcon`, `destinationWaypointIcon`, `restrictedRoadDashArray`, `restrictedRoadOpacity` and `restrictedRoadLineWidth` were moved to `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions`
2. `trafficBackfillRoadClasses` was moved to `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions`
3. `scaleExpression` properties were moved to `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions#scaleExpressions` wrapper of type `RouteLineScaleExpressions`
4. `roundedLineCap` property was removed
- Moved `congestionRange` properties from `RouteLineColorResources` to `MapboxRouteLineApiOptions`.
- Removed `MapboxRouteLineOptions#routeStyleDescriptors` option.
- Removed the possibility of modify and reading data from `RouteLineSetValue`, `RouteLineClearValue` and `RouteLineUpdateValue`. Do not use these classes on your side, just pass the objects between `MapboxRouteLineAPI` and `MapboxRouteLineView`.
- `MapboxRouteLineAPI#options` and `MapboxRouteLineView#options` properties are no longer public.
- Made `RouteLineExpressionProvider` and `RouteLineTrimExpressionProvider` internal.
- Added a possibility to change a subset of `MapboxRouteLineViewOptions` in runtime without the need to recreate the components. The subset that can be changed is defined in `MapboxRouteLineViewDynamicOptionsBuilder`. To change the dynamic options in runtime, use the following code:
```
routeLineView.updateDynamicOptions(style) {
    routeLineColorResources(newColors)
    // ...
}
routeLineApi.getRouteDrawData {
    routeLineView.renderRouteDrawData(style, it)
}
```
- Split `RouteLineConfig#options` into `RouteLineConfig#apiOptions` and `RouteLineConfig#viewOptions`
- Added `RouteLineConfig#viewOptionsUpdates`.
- Removed `MapboxRouteLineApi#showRouteWithLegIndexHighlighted`, `MapboxRouteLineApi#setPrimaryTrafficColor` and `MapboxRouteLineApi#setAlternativeTrafficColor` methods.
- Changed `MapboxRouteLineApi#setVanishingOffset` method behavior in the following way: if the route had not been set to `MapboxRouteLineApi` prior to the point when `setVanishingOffset` was invoked, it will return an error now. Previously it used to return a value, which was, however, useless for rendering without the route.
- Fixed an issue when soft gradient was not applied correctly in `MapboxRouteLineApi#setVanishingOffset` result.

#### Bug fixes and improvements
- Fix adas tiles eviction algorithm
- Fixed a mapmatching issue where the position might have been snapped to the wrong part of a highway after leaving tunnel
- Improve GNSS jump detection for better pitch based map-matching in tunnels
- Eliminate border crossing object when moving to neutral waters and back

- Improved handling of no storage available during navigation tiles downloading. 
- Improved handling of invalid config in `DeviceProfile#customConfig`. 
- Fixed a native crash in E-Horizon implementation caused by internal race condition. 
- Made `MapboxReplayer` constructor public. 
- Removed `OnlineRouteAlternativesSwitch`. Use `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver` to receive an online alternative for the current offline route. Unlike `OnlineRouteAlternativesSwitch`, `NavigationRouteAlternativesObserver` doesn't switch to an online alternative automatically. 
- Changed structure of `NavigationRoute`. Now it can represent routes received from Mapbox Map Matching API as well as Mapbox Directions API.
  `NavigationRoute#directionsResponse` has been removed. Use `NavigationRoute#waypoints`, `NavigationRoute#responseUUID`, and `NavigationRoute#responseMetadata` to access data which used to be available via `NavigationRoute#directionsResponse`.
  `NavigationRoute#routeOptions` has been removed. Try to utilise data available in `NavigationRoute`, for example instead of using coordinates from route options, use `NavigationRoute#waypoints`. Temporary property `NavigationRoute#evMaxCharge` has been added to access maximum possible charge for the vehicle the route was requested for instead of `navigationRoute.routeOptions.getUnrecognizedProperty("ev_max_charge")`.
  
- Added `MapMatchingSuccessfulResult#navigationRoutes` which represent routes that could be set to navigator using `MapboxNavigation#setNavigationRoutes`. 
- Changed type of `MapMatchingSuccessfulResult#matches` from `List<NavigationRoute>` to `List<MapMatchingMatch>`. Now every item from `MapMatchingSuccessfulResult#matches` represents a Match Object from Mapbox Map Matching API. 

## Features
- Changed LocationOptions API. Now custom location providers that emit mocked locations are allowed. In order to set a custom location provider, you now need to invoke `LocationOptions.Builder#locationProviderFactory` and pass a factory that will create a DeviceLocationProvider implementation based on a request parameter together will location provider type, which can be one of: REAL, MOCKED, MIXED. Note that if your provider can emit non-real locations, it must set `isMock` extra flag value to true for such locations. To set this flag, use:
```
Location.Builder#extra(Value.valueOf(hashMapOf(LocationExtraKeys.IS_MOCK to Value.valueOf(true/false))))
```
 
- Added Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) functionality as an experimental API. 
- Added `NavigationViewApi#recenterCamera()` that allows to programatically recenter the camera position as if the recenter button was clicked.
