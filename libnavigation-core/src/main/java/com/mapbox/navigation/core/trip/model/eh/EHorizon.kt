/**
 * An Electronic Horizon is a probable path (or paths) of a vehicle within the road graph which is
 * used to surface metadata about the underlying edges of the graph for a certain distance in front
 * of the vehicle thus extending the user's perspective beyond the “visible” horizon.
 *
 * Mapbox Electronic Horizon correlates the vehicle’s location to the road graph and broadcasts
 * updates to the Electronic Horizon as the vehicle’s position and trajectory change.
 *
 * In Active Guidance state, the user-selected route and its metadata are used as the path for the
 * Electronic Horizon. In a Free Drive state there is no active route selected, Mapbox Electronic
 * Horizon will determine the most probable path from the vehicle’s current location.
 * For both states Active Guidance and Free Drive, the Electronic Horizon and its metadata are
 * exposed via the same interface as described below.
 *
 * We represent the road network ahead of us as a tree of edges. Each intersection has outbound
 * edges and each edge has probability of transition to another edge as well as metadata which
 * can be used to implement sophisticated features on top of it.
 *
 * The EHorizon is a simple tree structure that can be navigated easily by traversing the Edges and
 * their outgoing connections. This can be done by simply looping over the Edges or using a Visitor.
 * For common cases, a number of utilities have been added which are described below.
