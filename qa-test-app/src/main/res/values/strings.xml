    <string name="alternative_route_selection_description" tools:ignore="MissingTranslation">Tests the selecting of an alternative route line. \n\n1. Long press a point on the map in order to get a primary route and at least one alternative route. \n\n2. Select an alternative route by touching it. The touched route should appear as the primary route and the previous primary route should appear as an alternative. \n\n3. Click start navigation and make sure the puck follows the selected route.</string>
    <string name="custom_alternative_route_color_description" tools:ignore="MissingTranslation">Tests overriding the default alternative route colors with custom colors. \n\nThe screen should display 3 route lines.  One blue line that represents the primary route line as well as a yellow line with a green border and a cyan colored line with a magenta boarder. \n\nThis indicates the two alternative route lines have been colored with the custom colors indicated in the activity.</string>

    <string name="route_restriction_activity_description" translatable="false">Displays two restricted sections of a route. \n\nYou should see two dashed lines near the middle of the route that have a magenta coloring. \n\nThe first line should end at an intersection with the second dashed line starting at the next intersection.  \n\nDuring navigation the restricted section should vanish along with the rest of the route line.</string>
    <string name="road_object_activity_description" translatable="false">Displays all road objects on a route line. It also displays upcoming road objects as the route progresses. \n\n Upon starting the activity, you should see all the road objects present in the route in the form of text at bottom left corner of the screen.\n\nOnce you press start navigation, you should see upcoming road objects as you progress.\n\nYou would need a special access token to make this activity work.</string>
    <string name="dynamic_traffic_update_description" translatable="false">Dynamically adjusts the traffic congestion on a route line. \n\nBriefly after the activity starts the traffic congestion on the route line will be randomly updated. \n\nNotice the route line is partially \"vanished\".

    <string name="inactive_route_styling_description" translatable="false">The inactive leg of the route should be colored differently than the active leg. \n\nWhen the activity starts you should see a route with a waypoint roughly in the middle. Notice the styling of the route which includes traffic congestion. \n\nStart navigation and the second leg of the route should change color. \n\nWhen the puck reaches the waypoint and transitions to the second leg the first leg should take on the coloring of the second leg and the second leg should appear as it did before navigation with the traffic congestion markers.</string>
    <string name="inactive_route_styling__with_restrictions_description" translatable="false">Same as the inactive route route leg styling activity with the addition of route restrictions and the vanishing route line.\n\nThe restricted section starts at the end of the first leg and the beginning of the second leg. The restricted section is colored magenta.\n\nThe restricted section on the second leg won\'t appear until the second leg becomes active. The magenta dashed line should vanish beneath the puck with the rest of the route line.</string>
    <string name="traffic_gradient_styling_description" translatable="false">The line used for representing traffic congestion can display a gradient transition between colors or hard stops between colors. \n\nThis activity lets you toggle between the two styles. \n\nWhen selecting between hard and soft gradients you should see the traffic line change, reflecting the option chosen.</string>

The blue line is the primary route line. Selecting alternate routes should change the colors such that the line touched turns blue indicating it is the primary route. \n\nOne important use case to observe is: \n\n1. Hide the primary route. \n\n2. Select an alternative route. \n\n3. Notice the route selected becomes the primary route and then disappears, maintaining its state as hidden, while the original primary route line appears colored as an alternative.</string>
