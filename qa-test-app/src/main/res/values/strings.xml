    <string name="inactive_route_styling__with_restrictions_description" translatable="false">Same as the inactive route route leg styling activity with the addition of route restrictions and the vanishing route line.\n\nThe restricted section starts at the end of the first leg and the beginning of the second leg.

The magenta dashed line should vanish beneath the puck with the rest of the route line.</string>
    <string name="traffic_gradient_styling_description" translatable="false">The line used for representing traffic congestion can display a gradient transition between colors or hard stops between colors. \n\nThis activity lets you toggle between the two styles. \n\nWhen selecting between hard and soft gradients you should see the traffic line change, reflecting the option chosen.</string>
