# Mapbox Navigation SDK - Minimum Compile Example (`app-mincompile`)

## Overview
`app-mincompile` is a specialized example within that is used to demonstrate the compatibility of the Mapbox Navigation SDK with older Android compile versions. The primary goal of this example is to ensure and showcase that our solutions can be effectively utilized on a range of Android versions, with a special focus on older, less common compile versions often used in automotive systems.

## Features
- Implementation of the Mapbox Navigation SDK with compatibility for older Android compile versions (compile SDK 30).
- Illustration of how to maintain functionality and performance with the SDK on older versions of Android.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Minimum Android SDK version: 21 (or your minimum supported version)
- Target Compile SDK version: 30

### Installation
1. Clone the Mapbox Navigation Android repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android.git
   ```
2. Open the `app-mincompile` module in Android Studio.
3. Build the project and resolve any dependencies.

### Running the Example
- Open the `app-mincompile` module in Android Studio.
- Select a device or emulator that runs Android SDK version 21 or higher.
- Run the application to observe the SDK's performance on older Android versions.

## Usage
This example demonstrates essential navigation features, ensuring they perform seamlessly on older Android versions:
- Basic setup and initialization of the Mapbox Navigation SDK.
- Displaying routes and providing navigation instructions.
- Ensuring key features remain effective and efficient on a range of Android versions.
